# ECE6: Assignment 2

Full coverage for all reachable statements in the class SymExec is achieved. Only an assert False is not reached as the parser will not pass a symbol that is not <,>,=,>=,<= for AExp.

Replace FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, WATIAM, and STUDENT_ID, EMAIL in
`user.yml` by your first and last name, WatIAM id, student number, and
email, respectively. Note that your WatIAM id is the ID you use to
login to Quest. Use plain ASCII characters as much as possible.

Do not change the format of the file. We will parse it
automatically. Only enter the information requested.
